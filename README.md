This is a small arcade game project for CSSE220 with inspiration from Joust

Get the Drop on your enemies (literally)

work through multiple challenging levels (maybe a little too challenging on some)

collect 'em eggs for points (get as many as you can)

try not to die (no point, you WILL die)

Features include:

*   movable character
*   easily expandable and slightly jank physics engine
*   2 different monsters (one fires things)
*   1 very agressive AI
*   7 different levels
*   persistant save/load games
*   persistant leaderboard
*   all the levels in the levels folder are automagically loaded, no need to add filenames to the source
*   neato menus
*   clean lean and mean graphics (gotta love those colorful blocks)

System Requirements:

HardWare

*   something decent

Software

*   Java 8 or higher, will not compile on < Java 8

Branches:

*   check out master for the latest changes, this is the beta branch, all functions may not work
*   check out milestone for stable releases, works well but may not have all features
